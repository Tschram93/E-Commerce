## Installation

Once the project has been cloned down to your local machine. run an ```npm i``` command to install the necessary dependencies. MySQL is required to be installed and used as well. Once these steps have been taken run the command ```npm run start``` in the terminal.  Once the messages display that the project has been seeded and a server is running, view everything on an API client. For this, I personally used Insomnia.

## Usage

With an API Client you can view and set up the endpoints found in the different routes and test each CRUD functionality for Products, Tags, and Categories.
